# Single Cell Data Analysis 

This repository contains all my work regarding single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. You will find standard workflow analysis as well as some practices. 

## Content: 

- scRNA-seq analysis.R: Basic workflow and steps. Create a Seurat object, QC, Filtering and normalization, identify high variable features, scaling data, PCA and clustering, UMAP.
  
- scRNA-seq analysis example.R: Example including all basic steps + visualization plots and differential expression (DE).
  
- annotateSingleR.R: script to annotate cell types from the clusters with single R  validation and diagnosis of the annotation. 

- annotateSingleR_multipeRefs.R: Annotation of cell types with multiple references
