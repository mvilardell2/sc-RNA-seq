# Single Cell Data Analysis 

This repository contains all my work regarding single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. You will find standard workflow analysis as well as some practices. 

## Content: 

- Gene_expression_analysis: Folder that contains R basic workflow and some steps to analyse gene expression data. 

- VDJ: Analysis of immune repertoire BCR and TCR. Cell ranger and analysis in R. 

- Data formats for scRNA-seq.R: Methods to read different type of single cell formats. 

- Seurat_tips.R: Useful commands to explore seurat objects. 




- scRNA-seq analysis.R: Basic workflow and steps. Create a Seurat object, QC, Filtering and normalization, identify high variable features, scaling data, PCA and clustering, UMAP.
  
- scRNA-seq analysis example.R: Example including all basic steps + visualization plots and differential expression (DE).
  
- annotateSingleR.R: script to annotate cell types from the clusters with single R  validation and diagnosis of the annotation. 

- annotateSingleR_multipeRefs.R: Annotation of cell types with multiple references
